<H4>Pat-a-pan (only the first verse of this old Burgundian carol is synthesised)</H4>
<P>
Note that there is no instrumental accompaniment in this synthesis, only voice harmony.

God and man this day are one,<BR>
Even more than fife and drum;<BR>
So these instruments we play,<BR>
Tu-re-lu-re-lu, pat-a-pat-a-pan,<BR>
So these instruments we play<BR>
For a joyful Christmas day!

This synthesis was produced as a pre-Christmas teaser for advertising
puposes for <I>Trillium Sound Research Inc</I> in 1994.  There are 16
unaccompanied male voices in four parts&#8212;arranged by Leonard
Manzara&#8212;and located in a virtual hall 20 metres by 30 metres
using acoustic imaging software developed by Leonard for the technical
part of his doctoral thesis in music from the SUNY at Buffalo (Manzara
1990).  Because it is a carol, the rhythm and intonation for the four
parts are musically determined and not composed by the rhythm and
intonation rules used for the other examples.  Some variation was
introduced between voices singing the same parts.  Only the sopranos
sing the lyrics above, the other parts sing &#8220;pat-a-pan&#8221; in
various ways.  The composition was completed before the system was
finalised, so there are some deficiencies, notably in the balance
between voiced and unvoiced sound. The sixteen different voices and
acoustic imaging required significant effort which has not been
repeated since the system achieved release status.
