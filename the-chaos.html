<H4>The Chaos: a poem by Charivarius</H4>
<P>
Note:
<OL>

<LI>the only input to the text-to-speech system was the text following
the file links;

<LI>this poem was written by by Dutchman G.N. Trenite for the
British <I>Punch</I> magazine under the <I>nom de plume</I>
&#8220;Charivarius&#8221; (1870-1946).  He wrote it to illustrate (and
complain about) the vagaries of British English spelling and
pronunciation&#8212;which is why it is a good test for the Gnuspeech
text-to-speech-system; and

<LI>a few words are still mispronounced because they require
grammatical or semantic information to choose appropriately (spotting
them is left as an exercise to the reader/listener, but distinguishing
&#8220;tear&#8221; in eye <I>versus</I> &#8220;tear&#8221; in dress
requires semantics, for example); some &#8220;correct&#8221;
pronunciations can be surprising, so you can easily be wrong; the poem
is actually instructional&#8212;the rhymes give much guidance, but the
mix of General American and British English accents in the synthesis
system spoils some of Trenite&$8217;s nice points&#8212;the vowels in
&#8220;ass&#8221; and &#8220;glass&#8221; are the same in General
American English, for example, whereas they are different in British
RP English;

<LI>it should be remembered that the system is a &#8220;first
cut&#8221;; all effort has gone into porting the system since it was
originally created, and none into improving the databases and
algorithms.

<P>
Dearest creature in creation,<BR>
Studying English pronunciation,<BR>
I will teach you in my verse<BR>
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.<BR>
It will keep you, Susy, busy,<BR>
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;<BR>
Tear in eye your dress you&#8217;ll tear.<BR>
So shall I!  Oh hear my prayer:<BR>
Pray console your loving poet,<BR>
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it.<BR>
Just compare heart, beard and heard,<BR>
Dies and diet, Lord and word.<BR>
Sword and sward, retain and Britain,<BR>
(Mind the latter, how it&#8217;s written).<BR>
Made has not the sound of bade,<BR>
Say&#8212;said, pay&#8212;paid, laid, but plaid.<BR>
Now I surely will not plague you<BR>
With such words as vague and ague,<BR>
But be careful how you speak:<BR>
Say break, steak, but bleak and streak,<BR>
Previous, precious; fuschia, via;<BR>
Pipe, shipe, recipe and choir;<BR>
Cloven, oven; how and low;<BR>
Script, receipt; shoe, poem, toe.<BR>
Hear me say, devoid of trickery;<BR>
Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore;<BR>

One, anemone; Balmoral,<BR>
Kitchen, lichen; laundry, laurel;<BR>
Gertrude, German; wind and mind;<BR>
Scene, Melpomene, mankind;<BR>
Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather.<BR>
This phonetic labyrinth<BR>
Gives moss, gross; brook, brooch; ninth, plinth.<BR>
Billet does not end like ballet;<BR>
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet;<BR>
Blood and flood are not like food,<BR>
Nor is mould like should and would.<BR>
Banquet is not nearly parquet,<BR>
Which is said to rime with darky.<BR>
Viscous, viscount; load and broad;<BR>
Toward, to forward, to reward.<BR>
And your pronunciation&#8217;s O.K.<BR>
When you say correctly; croquet;<BR>
Rounded, wounded; grieve and sieve;<BR>
Friend and fiend, alive and live,<BR>
Liberty, library; heave and heaven;<BR>
Rachel, ache, moustache; eleven.<BR>
We say hallowed, but allowed;<BR>

Mark the difference moreover<BR>
Between mover, plover, Dover;<BR>

Camel, constable, unstable,<BR>
Principle, discipline, label;<BR>
Petal, penal and canal;<BR>
Wait, surmise, plait, promise; pal.<BR>
Suit, suite, ruin; circuit, conduit,<BR>
Rime with: &#8220;shirk it&#8221; and &#8220;beyond it&#8221;;<BR>
But it is not hard to tell<BR>
Why it&#8217;s pall, mall, but PallMall.<BR>
Muscle, muscular; goal and iron;<BR>
Timber, climber; bullion and lion;<BR>
Worm and storm; chaise, chaos, chair;<BR>
Senator, spectator, mayor.<BR>
Ivy, privy; famous; clamour,<BR>
And enamour rime with &#8220;hammer&#8221;.<BR>
Pussy, hussy and possess,<BR>
Desert, but dessert, address.<BR>
Golf, wolf; countenants; lieutenants<BR>
Hoist, in lieu of flags, left pennants.<BR>
River, rival; tomb, bomb, comb;<BR>
Doll and roll, and some and home.<BR>
Stranger does not rime with anger,<BR>
Neither does devour with clangour.<BR>
Soul, but foul; and gaunt, but aunt;<BR>
Font, front, won&#8217;t; want, grand and grant;<BR>
Shoes, goes, does.  Now first say finger,<BR>
And then; singer, ginger, linger.<BR>
Real, zeal; mauve, gauze and gauge;<BR>
Marriage, foliage, mirage, age.<BR>
Query does not rime with very,<BR>
Nor does fury sound like bury.<BR>
Dost, lost, post; and doth, cloth, loth;<BR>

Though the difference seems little<BR>
We say actual, but victual;<BR>
Seat, sweat; chaste, caste; Leigh, eight, height;<BR>
Put, nut; granite but unite.<BR>

Say aver, but ever, fever,<BR>
Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.<BR>
Never guess&#8212;it is not safe;<BR>
We say calves, valves; half, but Ralf.<BR>
Heron, granary, canary;<BR>
Crevice and device and eyrie;<BR>
Face, preface, but efface,<BR>
Phlegm, phlegmatic; ass, glass, bass;<BR>
Large, but target, gin, give, verging;<BR>
Ought, out, joust and scour, but scourging;<BR>
Ear, but earn; and wear and tear<BR>
Do not rime with &#8220;here&#8221; but &#8220;ere&#8221;.<BR>
Seven is right, but so is even;<BR>
Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen;<BR>
Monkey, donkey; clerk and jerk;<BR>
Asp, grasp, wasp; and cork and work.<BR>
Pronunciation&#8212;think of psyche&#8212;<BR>
Is a paling, stout and spikey;<BR>
Won&#8217;t it make you lose your wits,<BR>
writing groats and saying &#8220;groats&#8221;?<BR>
It&#8217;s a dark abyss or tunnel,<BR>
Strewn with stones, like rowlock, gunwale,<BR>
Islington and Isle of Wight,<BR>
Housewife, verdict and indict.<BR>
Don&#8217;t you think so, reader, rather<BR>
Saying lather, bather, father?<BR>
Finally: which rimes with &#8220;enough&#8221;,<BR>
Though, through, plough, cough, hough or tough?<BR>
Hiccough has the sound of &#8220;cup&#8221;,<BR>
My advice is ... give it up!

This synthesis represents the current state of the Gnuspeech text-to-speech system. If you <A HREF="https://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/osx/trunk/Builds/?root=gnuspeech">download the software for the Mac</A> you can use "GnuTTSClient" to hear the conversion for test text. You can also use Monet to take test utterances and play with the intonation. Thanks to Steve Nygard and Dalmazio Brisinda for their essential help with getting the port to this stage.
