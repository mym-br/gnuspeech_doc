Leaping from tree to tree!  As they float down the mighty rivers of<BR>
British Columbia!  With my best girl by my side!<BR>
The Larch!<BR>
The Pine!<BR>
The Giant Redwood tree!<BR>
The Sequoia!<BR>
The Little Whopping Rule Tree!<BR>
We'd sing!  Sing!  Sing!

Oh, I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay,<BR>
I sleep all night and I work all day.

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,<BR>
I go to the lavatry.<BR>
On Wednesdays I go shoppin'<BR>
And have buttered scones for tea.
</P>

I cut down trees, I skip and jump,<BR>
I like to press wild flowers.<BR>
I put on women's clothing,<BR>
And hang around in bars.

I chop down trees, I wear high heels,<BR>
Suspenders and a bra.<BR>
I wish I'd been a girlie<BR>
Just like my dear papa.
</P>

<P>
He cuts down trees, he wears high heels<BR>
Suspenders and a .... a Bra????<BR>

He's a lumberjack, and he's okay.

This synthesis represents the current state of the Gnuspeech text-to-speech system. If you <A HREF="http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/osx/trunk/Builds/?root=gnuspeech">download the software for the Mac</A> you can use "GnuTTSClient" to hear the conversion for test text. You can also use Monet to take test utterances and play with the intonation. Thanks to Steve Nygard and Dalmazio Brisinda for their essential help with getting the port to this stage.
